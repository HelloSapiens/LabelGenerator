# LabelGenerator
A janky javascript/css/html bundle to help create and format stickers/labels with QR codes


This implementation relies on the user printing from their browsers... A bit of adjustments and fiddling around with margens etc. is probably required due to the peculiarities that occur in the mix of browsers, printers and operating systems. Good luck...
